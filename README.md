# ARYA-MOTO


ARYA-MOTO is a terminal-based Automobile Service Management System created in Python, designed with a focus on **ASCII aesthetics**, **modularity**, and **Linux CLI spirit**.  
It operates entirely from the terminal, making it lightweight, minimal, and perfect for retro hacker-style environments.

Why Terminal-Based?
This project was designed as a no-GUI challenge.
Where others might build a basic UI with Tkinter, ARYA-MOTO goes deeper, creating a full CLI experience with the feel of an elite black-ops dashboard.

Run the Project
python3 main.py

This project is modular. If you'd like to contribute:
